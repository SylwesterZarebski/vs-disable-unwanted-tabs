Initial release page here:  
http://erwinmayer.com/labs/visual-studio-2010-extension-disable-no-source-available-tab

**Description**

This small extension will prevent the tool window with title "No Source Available" from appearing in Visual Studio, and preserve the focus on the currently active tab.

**Supported editions**

Visual Studio 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017+.

Visual Studio 2010 support has been dropped due to limitations imposed by Microsoft's VSIX format to support Visual Studio 2017. The last stable release supporting Visual Studio 2010 can however be downloaded [here](https://github.com/mayerwin/vs-disable-no-source-tab/releases/tag/2.0).

You are welcome to contribute to this project!

This project is being supported by [Jetbrains][1]' excellent ReSharper, DotTrace and DotMemory extensions.
